# Crop-Yield-Forecasting-using-MLP
Crop Yield Forecasting using Neural Networks (MLP) Machine learning project that predicts next-year crop yields using a Keras-based Multilayer Perceptron trained on historical agricultural data. Implements feature scaling, categorical encoding, regularisation, and quantitative evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²) for robust forecasting.
